# Swarm-Payload-Transport-Research-project-
This project presents an agent-based model that investigates collective payload transport in a toroidal arena. Each Agent follows a Vicsek alignment rule augmented by weak chemotactic signals emitted by payload and target. Motility-induced phase separation emerges as the driving mechanism.
